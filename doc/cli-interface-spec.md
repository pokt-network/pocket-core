# Pocket Core CLI Interface Specification
## Version 0.0.1

### Overview
This document serves as a specification for the Command Line Interface of the Pocket Core application. There's no protocol verification for these commands because they map closely to protocol functions.

### Namespaces
The CLI will contain multiple namespaces listed below:

- Default Namespace: These functions will be called when the namespace is blank
- Accounts: Contains all the calls pertinent to accounts and their local storage.
- Nodes: Contains all the functions for Node upkeep.
- Apps: Contains all the functions for app upkeep.
- Query: All queries to the world state are contained in this call.

### CLI Functions Format
Each CLI Function will be in the following format:

- Binary Name: The name of the binary for Pocket Core, for example: `pocket`
- Namespace: The namespace of the function, or blank for the default namespace: `accounts`
- Function Name: The name of the actual function to be called: `create`
- (Optional): Space separated function arguments, e.g.: `pocket accounts create <passphrase>`

### Default Namespace
The default namespace contains functions that are pertinent to the execution of the Pocket Node.

- `pocket start <datadir>`
> Starts the Pocket Node, picks up the config from the assigned `<datadir>`.
>
> Arguments:
> - `<datadir>`: The data directory where the configuration files for this node are specified.

- `pocket reset`
> Reset the Pocket node.
> Deletes the following files / folders:
> - .pocket/data
> - priv_val_key
> - priv_val_state
> - node_keys
>

### Accounts Namespace Functions
The `accounts` namespace handles all account related interactions, from creating and deleting accounts, to importing and exporting accounts.
