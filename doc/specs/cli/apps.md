# Apps Namespace

## Stake an App / Update Stake

```text
pocket app stake <fromAddr> <amount> <relayChainIDs> <chainID> <fee>
```

Stakes the Application into the network, making it available to receive service. Prompts the user for the `<fromAddr>` account passphrase.

After the 0.6.X upgrade, if the app is already staked, this transaction acts as an _update_ transaction. An app can update `<relayChainIDs>` and increase the stake `<amount>`. If the app is currently staked at `X` and you submit an update with new stake `Y`, only `Y-X` will be subtracted from an account. If no changes are desired for the parameter, just enter the current parameter value \(the same one you entered for your initial stake\).

Arguments:

* `<fromAddr>`: Target Address to stake.
* `<amount>`: The amount of uPOKT to stake. Must be higher than the current value of the `ApplicationStakeMinimum`  parameter, found [here](https://docs.pokt.network/home/references/protocol-parameters#applicationstakeminimum).
* `<relayChainIDs>`: A comma separated list of RelayChain Network Identifiers. Find the RelayChain Network Identifiers [here](https://docs.pokt.network/home/references/supported-blockchains).
* `<chainID>`: The Pocket chain identifier; "mainnet" or "testnet".
* `<fee>`:  An amount of uPOKT for the network.

Example output:

```text
Transaction submitted with hash: <Transaction Hash>
```

## Unstake an App

```text
pocket app unstake <fromAddr> <chainID> <fee>
```

Unstakes an Application from the `<chainID>` network, changing its status to `Unstaking`. Prompts the user for the `<fromAddr>` account passphrase.

Arguments:

* `<fromAddr>`: The address of the sender.
* `<chainID>`: The Pocket chain identifier; "mainnet" or "testnet".
* `<fee>`:  An amount of uPOKT for the network.

Example output:

```text
Transaction submitted with hash: <Transaction Hash>
```

## Create an Application Authentication Token \(AAT\)

```text
pocket app create-aat <appAddr> <clientPubKey>
```

Creates a signed application authentication token \(version `0.0.1` of the AAT spec\), that can be embedded into application software for Relay servicing. Will prompt the user for the `<appAddr>` account passphrase.

Read the Application Authentication Token documentation here:

{% page-ref page="../application-auth-token.md" %}

_**NOTE: USE THIS METHOD AT YOUR OWN RISK. READ THE APPLICATION SECURITY GUIDELINES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE RECOMMENDED AAT CONFIGURATION FOR YOUR APPLICATION.**_

Arguments:

* `<appAddr>`: The address of the Application account to use to produce this AAT.
* `<clientPubKey>`: The account public key of the client that will be signing and sending Relays sent to the Pocket Network.

Example output:

```javascript
{
"version": "0.0.1",
"applicationPublicKey": "0x...",
"clientPublicKey": "0x...",
"signature": "0x..."
}
```
