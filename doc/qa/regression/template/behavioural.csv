MaxApplications - make sure is enabled after upgradeHeight.,358,,,,,,
MaxApplications - make sure N quantity of APPs can be staked before the upgradeHeight.,359,,,,,,
MaxApplications - Enabled - Block new exceeding APPs to stake.,360,,,,,,
MaxApplications - Enabled and Reached - Unstaking APPs allow new staking APP to be staked.,361,,,,,,
MaxApplications - Enabled and Decreased - Existing staked APPs remain staked.,362,,,,,,
MaxApplications - Enabled and Decreased - Existing staked APPs remain staked (if they are greater than maxAPP),363,,,,,,

If a node removes that chain from their list they will not get paid for that claim / proof,366,,,,,,
The v1/dispatch sequence should not show the node anymore -,367,,,,,,
"If an app removes the chain from the list, a node should stop servicing the APP ",368,,,,,,
A node should get paid for an app that changed mid session,369,,,,,,
If an app updates stake and Max relays the node cannot do more than previous max relays,370,,,,,,
If a node changes service url the change should happen right away in the v1/dispatch sequence,371,,,,,,
