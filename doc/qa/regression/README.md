# Pocket Core Regression Test Suite

## Overview

The Regression Test Suite is a series of test scenarios to be manually run to produce a full QA report. The files under [template](./template) serve as a base for the tester to produce the QA report with every execution of the Test Suite.

## Running the suite

Please refer to the scenario steps described in the [Pocket Core Func Tests Repository](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-core-func-tests) to see each scenario test steps and complete the run accordingly. The repository also contains a list of Genesis files to be used in different test scenarios in order to modify the environment state and produce the necessary results for the test scenario.
