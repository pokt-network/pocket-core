# Pocket Pruner

C0D3R provides [a pruning tool](https://github.com/msmania/pocket-pruner/) for Pocket Network.
You can use it for your servicers and validators.  Do not prune a node that is
pointed as a RelayChain endpoint in chains.json.

For any pruner related issues, please contact [C0D3R support](mailto:support@@c0d3r.org)
or [their discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1067167998416269353/1070255553265274910).
